    <string name="fog_pig_full_text">Inhabitants are to be wary of low visibility conditions while away from home. It is standard to carry an oil lantern in the house and while traveling. During the event of a low visibility incident, an oil lantern is to be kept on at all times. Other sources of light have yielded inconsistent results in preventing contact with Fog Pig. Candles are considered an alternative when an oil lantern has failed or is unavailable. Candles can stop a contact event however there is a high likelihood for permanent psychological damage due to proximity to Fog Pig. (See Light log below)
